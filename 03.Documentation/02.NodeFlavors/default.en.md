During the setup of new nodes in a cluster you can select a respective "flavor" for that node.

Flavors determine the amount of processing cores ("CPUs"), Memory ("GB RAM") and disk space ("GB Disk") of the respective node.

A good practice for choosing the right flavor for your project is cycling through the following steps:
1. Start by selecting a small flavor.
2. Evaluate the performance of the desired use case.
3. Pick a larger flavor in case of any issues.
